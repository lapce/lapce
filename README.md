Lapce (IPA: /læps/) is written in pure Rust, with a UI in [Floem](https://github.com/lapce/floem). It is designed with [Rope Science](https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_00.html) from the [Xi-Editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor), enabling lightning-fast computation, and leverages [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for rendering. More information about the features of Lapce can be found on the [main website](https://lapce.dev) and user documentation can be found on [GitBook](https://docs.lapce.dev/).

## Features

* Built-in LSP ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) support to give you intelligent code features such as: completion, diagnostics and code actions
* Modal editing support as first class citizen (Vim-like, and toggleable)
* Built-in remote development support inspired by [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Enjoy the benefits of a "local" experience, and seamlessly gain the full power of a remote system. We also have [Lapdev](https://lap.dev/) which can help manage your remote dev environments. 
* Plugins can be written in programming languages that can compile to the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) format (C, Rust, [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/))
* Built-in terminal, so you can execute commands in your workspace, without leaving Lapce.
