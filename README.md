Lapce (IPA: /lÃ¦ps/) is written in pure Rust with a UI in [Druid](https://github.com/linebender/druid) (which is also written in Rust). It is designed with [Rope Science](https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_00.html) from the [Xi-Editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor) which makes for lightning-fast computation, and leverages [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) for rendering. More information about the features of Lapce can be found on the [main website](https://lapce.dev) and user documentation can be found on [GitBook](https://docs.lapce.dev/).

## Features

* Built-in LSP ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) support to give you intelligent code features such as: completion, diagnostics and code actions
* Modal editing support as first class citizen (Vim-like, and toggleable)
* Built-in remote development support inspired by [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Enjoy the benefits of a "local" experience, and seamlessly gain the full power of a remote system.
* Plugins can be written in programming languages that can compile to the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) format (C, Rust, [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/))
* Built-in terminal, so you can execute commands in your workspace, without leaving Lapce.

## Building from source

It is easy to build Lapce from source on a GNU/Linux distribution. Cargo handles the build process, all you need to do, is ensure the correct dependencies are installed.

1. Install the Rust compiler and Cargo using [`rustup.rs`](https://rustup.rs/). If you already have the toolchain, ensure you are using version 1.62 or higher.

2. Install dependencies for your operating system:

#### Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt install cmake pkg-config libfontconfig-dev libgtk-3-dev
```
#### Fedora
```sh
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ perl-FindBin perl-File-Compare gtk3-devel
```

3. Clone this repository (this command will clone to your home directory):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lapce/lapce.git ~/lapce
```

4. `cd` into the repository, and run the build command with the release flag
```sh
cd ~/lapce
```

```sh
cargo build --release
```

> If you use a different distribution, and are having trouble finding appropriate dependencies, let us know in an issue!

Once Lapce is compiled, the executable will be available in `target/release/lapce`.
