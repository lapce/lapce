# A profile which compiles all (non-workspace) dependencies in release mode
# but Lapce code in dev mode. This gives a good debugging experience for your
# code and fast performance of other people's code. After the initial
# build subsequent ones are as fast as dev mode builds.
# See https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html
# To use this profile:
#   cargo build --profile fastdev
#   cargo run --profile fastdev --bin lapce
